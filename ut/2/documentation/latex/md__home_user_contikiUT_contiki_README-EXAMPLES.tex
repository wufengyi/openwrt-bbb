The examples/ directory contains a few examples that will help you get started with Contiki.

To run the example programs, you need either to be running Linux or Free\+B\+S\+D (or any other U\+N\+I\+X-\/type system), or install Cygwin if you are running Microsoft Windows \href{http://cygwin.com}{\tt http\+://cygwin.\+com}. As a minimum you will need to have the gcc C compiler installed. To run the examples in the \textquotesingle{}netsim\textquotesingle{} target, you need to have G\+T\+K 1.\+x development libraries installed. These are usually called \textquotesingle{}gtk-\/devel\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}libgtk1-\/devel\textquotesingle{} or similar in your Linux software installation programs.

\subsection*{compile-\/platforms/ }

A test script that compiles Contiki for a number of platforms and reports any errors found during the build.

\subsection*{email/ }

An email program supporting S\+M\+T\+P. It can be compiled and run in the \textquotesingle{}win32\textquotesingle{} target by typing the following commands\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cd examples/email
make
./email-client.win32
\end{DoxyVerb}


Most likely you\textquotesingle{}ll have to adjust the T\+C\+P/\+I\+P values set in \hyperlink{group__IPV6_ga0c99d968a34e803d378692bde2e3f18f}{main()} in platform/win32/contiki-\/main.\+c to match your needs.

Please consult cpu/native/net/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E-\/\+W\+P\+C\+A\+P.\+md as well.

\subsection*{esb/ }

A set of demo applications for the E\+S\+B board.

\subsection*{ftp/ }

An F\+T\+P client supporting download. It can be compiled and run in the \textquotesingle{}win32\textquotesingle{} target by typing the following commands\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cd examples/ftp
make
./ftp-client.win32
\end{DoxyVerb}


Most likely you\textquotesingle{}ll have to adjust the T\+C\+P/\+I\+P values set in \hyperlink{group__IPV6_ga0c99d968a34e803d378692bde2e3f18f}{main()} in platform/win32/contiki-\/main.\+c to match your needs.

Please consult cpu/native/net/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E-\/\+W\+P\+C\+A\+P.\+md as well.

\subsection*{hello-\/world/ }

A really simple Contiki program that shows how to write Contiki programs. To compile and test the program, go into the hello-\/world directory\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cd examples/hello-world
\end{DoxyVerb}


Run the \textquotesingle{}make\textquotesingle{} command. \begin{DoxyVerb}make
\end{DoxyVerb}


This will compile the hello-\/world program in the \textquotesingle{}native\textquotesingle{} target. This causes the entire Contiki operating system and the hello-\/world application to be compiled into a single program that can be run by typing the following command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}./hello-world.native
\end{DoxyVerb}


This will print out the following text\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}Contiki initiated, now starting process scheduling
Hello, world
\end{DoxyVerb}


The program will then appear to hang, and must be stopped by pressing the C key while holding down the Control key.

\subsection*{irc/ }

An I\+R\+C client. It can be compiled and run in the \textquotesingle{}win32\textquotesingle{} target by typing the following commands\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cd examples/irc
make
./irc-client.win32
\end{DoxyVerb}


Most likely you\textquotesingle{}ll have to adjust the T\+C\+P/\+I\+P values set in \hyperlink{group__IPV6_ga0c99d968a34e803d378692bde2e3f18f}{main()} in platform/win32/contiki-\/main.\+c to match your needs.

Please consult cpu/native/net/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E-\/\+W\+P\+C\+A\+P.\+md as well.

\subsection*{multi-\/threading/ }

A quite simple demonstration of the Contiki multi-\/threading library employing two worker threads each running a recursive function. It can be compiled and run in the \textquotesingle{}native\textquotesingle{} target by typing the following commands\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cd examples/multi-threading
make
./multi-threading.native
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{rime/ }

Contains a set of examples on how to use the Rime communications stack. To run those examples in the \textquotesingle{}netsim\textquotesingle{} target (a very simple Contiki network simulator), compile the programs with\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}make TARGET=netsim
\end{DoxyVerb}


You will need to have G\+T\+K 1.\+x development libraries installed.

Run the different programs\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}./test-abc.netsim
./test-meshroute.netsim
./test-rudolph0.netsim
./test-rudolph1.netsim
./test-treeroute.netsim
./test-trickle.netsim
\end{DoxyVerb}


Most of the examples requires you to click with the middle mouse button on one of the simulated nodes for something to happen.

\subsection*{sky/ }

Examples inteded for running on the Tmote Sky board. To compile those, you need to have msp430-\/gcc (the gcc C compiler for the M\+S\+P430 microcontroller) installed.
