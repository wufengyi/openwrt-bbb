Contiki is an open source operating system that runs on tiny low-\/power microcontrollers and makes it possible to develop applications that make efficient use of the hardware while providing standardized low-\/power wireless communication for a range of hardware platforms.

Contiki is used in numerous commercial and non-\/commercial systems, such as city sound monitoring, street lights, networked electrical power meters, industrial monitoring, radiation monitoring, construction site monitoring, alarm systems, remote house monitoring, and so on.
